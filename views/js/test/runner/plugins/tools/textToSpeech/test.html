                With my winter time
                My idols and stage fright
                In another night
                Where the lights are loud and bright

                One dream from waking up saved
                Too shy to hold in the rage

                I know no luxury
                Of knowing what your eyes read
                I know one million ways
                To always pick the wrong thing to say

                A love that you never gave
                Always a time zone away
                It's not out of spite
                I know what's right

                Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye

                Sometimes a memory
                Only sees what it wants to believe
                And what's filled in between
                Are days and nights that don't mean a thing

                Such a simple suicide
                A second chance never tried
                And you don't understand
                I need a helping hand

                So you think that you've seen it all
                Is that a fact?
                So out your mouth a dictionary
                Spouts about this and that
                You got your do's, your don'ts
                Because and why
                I don't trust no one who don't
                Take their own advice

                Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye
